## How it Works
Download the zipped file and open WeatherSearchApp > WeatherSearchApp.xcodeproj.  For running the project, make sure your simulator or device is running iOS 15.0 or higher.

## On Simulator
On a similator you'll have to ensure your location is set.  Before launching the app, make sure to check Features > Location > Custom Location from the selected simulator's menu bar

Troubleshooting this will involve making sure the custom coordinates set are assocaited with a real city. In the example the coordinates 41.881832 N, 87,623177 W represent the windy city Chicago
